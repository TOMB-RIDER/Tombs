This blog post will cover the creator's perspective, challenge motives, and the write-up of the web challenge Felonious Forums from Business CTF 2022. The challenge portrays a functional forums application and involves exploiting a self XSS and chaining it with Cache Poisoning for a client-side attack to steal session cookies.
