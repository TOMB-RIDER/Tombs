	<p id="about-description">
Hey there! My name is Rayhan Ahmed Niloy, and I go by the handle "Rayhan0x01" online.<br>
I'm a junior AppSec Content Engineer at <a href="https://www.hackthebox.com/" target="_blank">Hack The Box</a> and one of the CTF creators at <a href="https://redteamvillage.io/" target="_blank">RedTeamVillage</a>.<br>
I love Hacking, Programming, Automating Stuff, and CTFs! I have helped build and host many successful community CTFs in the past, the DEF CON 29 RedTeamVillage CTF being the biggest one so far with a few fantastic folks from <a href="https://threatsims.com/">ThreatSimulations</a>!<br><br>
In terms of certifications, I have earned OSCP, and OSWE allegedly being the youngest (OSCP) and the first (OSWE) in my country!<br>
I also spent a significant amount of time training at <a href="https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/60115"  target="_blank">Hack The Box</a>.<br><br>
As for hobbies, I love to play chess (even though I am not good at it) and occasionally like to do minimalistic digital arts on <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/minimalrayhan" target="_blank">DeviantArt</a>!<br><br>
