I am a self-motivated CyberSecurity enthusiast currently studying at Daffodil International University. I love Hacking, Hackish Programming, Automating Stuff, and Finding Vulnerabilities! I taught myself to code when I was fifteen. Since then my interest in programming gradually shifted to Infosec and penetration testing. At the end of the day, my main goal remains the same which is to be a more skilled version of myself than yesterday. <br>Apparently, I am also the youngest OSCP in my country!
