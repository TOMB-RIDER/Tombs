I am a self-motivated CyberSecurity enthusiast currently studying BSc in Software Engineering. I love Hacking, Hackish Programming, Automating Stuff, and Finding Vulnerabilities! I taught myself to code when I was fifteen. Since then my interest in programming gradually shifted to Infosec and penetration testing. At the end of the day, my main goal remains the same that is to be a more skilled version of myself than yesterday. <br>I am one of the youngest OSCP in my country and probably the first OSWE in my country!
<br>Currently, I create and help organize CTF challenges for community CTF events with few amazing folks from <a href="https://threatsims.com/">ThreatSimulations</a>.
